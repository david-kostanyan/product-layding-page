                    Automatic transmission is a multi-speed transmission that does not
                    require gear shifting while driving. Automatic transmission is the
                    most technologically advanced unit of a modern car, which consumes a
                    huge amount of electrical, mechanical, hydraulic and electronic
                    components, provides a drive of the car with maximum comfort at
                    minimum fuel consumption.

                    On average, gasoline internal combustion engines are designed for
                    300 thousand km. The resource of diesel engines is 400 thousand
                    kilometers and more. There are successful engines, there are not
                    very successful ones. But much depends on the nature of operation,
                    quality and timeliness of car maintenance. Sooner or later, engine
                    diagnostics and repairs are required. Overhaul is understood as the
                    process of removing the internal combustion engine from the vehicle
                    for subsequent complete disassembly. Automotive craftsmen inspect
                    the cylinder block, cylinder head, crankshaft and piston group for
                    defects. Make a conclusion and establish a list of repairs.

                    The chassis is one of the loaded systems of the vehicle. With the
                    movement of the car, forces appear that act on parts and mechanisms.
                    Wear and tear of running car components leads to the appearance of
                    noise, vibrations, comfort and safety deteriorates. Running gear
                    diagnostics is required even if you do not feel discomfort and do
                    not see the reasons for contacting a service center.
